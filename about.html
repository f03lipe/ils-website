	<p>The Ivy Leadership Council is a student-run organization of Ivy League student leaders dedicated to fostering future leadership domestically and globally. Each year, the Council hosts the Ivy Leadership Summit (ILS), a two-day conference that brings together students from the eight Ivy League universities along with leaders from the business, government, academic, and humanitarian sectors.

	<p>This fall, Yale will be hosting the 16th annual Ivy Leadership Summit on November 11-13, 2016 in New Haven, CT. This yearâ€™s theme is Impetus: Driving Forward Visions for Positive Global Change. The conference will focus on how the youth can be empowered to turn an idea into a reality and create positive global change through leadership and compassion. This Summit seeks to inspire and educate students through motivating keynote speakers, breakout sessions, and student-led conversations about the steps we can each take to make those courageous steps in actualizing ideas into concrete action that will positively impact the world.
